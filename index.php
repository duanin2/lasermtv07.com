		<h2>Hi,</h2>
	<img src=misa.png width=145 />
		my name is <b>lasermtv07</b>, in real life named <b>Michal Chmelar</b>, and I am a 17 y.o. Czech programming student and computer enthusiast. I am studying database system. We still learn basic PHP (which I love), text files and SQL, which is not the <i>most modern</i> stuff, but to some extent I like that since it just works.
Unlike having to beat my head against a wall to know what in the hell is <i>hydration</i>. Other than that, I also try to learn other technologies relating to low level development. I am also learning digital electronics and even try to dabble into analog stuff, like oscillators or amplifiers.
I also have a weird obsession with <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language">esoteric</a> programming languages. So far Ive written a few esolang and made a few more <i>complicated</i> programs in brainfuck. </br></br>
Some time ago, I decided to try <b>GNU/Linux</b>, and have stuck with it ever since. As an editor, I use <b>Vim</b> with a pretty minimalistic config, because I am crazy. As a terminal,
I use <b>xterm</b>, because, as Ive stated previously, I am crazy.
Sadly, I am not yet crazy enough to use a standalone WM (I mean I tried, havent stuck with it), so I use <b>LXDE</b>. I explore da interwebs using the <b>Firefox</b> browser. 
For circuit simulations I use <b>Logisim</b>. I could talk about some other stuff I suppose, but no one cares about that anyway.
